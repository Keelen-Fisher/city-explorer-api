# city-explorer-api

**Author**: Keelen Fisher
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

In this lab assignment, you will begin building your own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application. This means users will get to see not only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that your server will manage.In this lab assignment, you will begin building your own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application.
