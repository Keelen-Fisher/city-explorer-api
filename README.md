# city-explorer-api

**Author**: Keelen Fisher
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

In this lab assignment, you will begin building your own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application. This means users will get to see not only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that your server will manage.In this lab assignment, you will begin building your own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application.

## Getting Started

All on Trello: [https://trello.com/c/t5TuFa6u/9-1-set-up-your-server-repository]

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:
